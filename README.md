# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Nicolas Ramos.

I'm a senior Electrical Engineering student at the University of Miami with a focus on RF and analog systems. I enjoy designing RF PCBs, simulating high-frequency circuits, and exploring the physics of electromagnetic and signal behavior. I'm always eager to learn and actively seek opportunities to grow within the evolving field of RF and microwave engineering.

This portfolio showcases hands-on technical projects that Iâ€™ve developed or contributed to, each aimed at deepening my understanding of embedded systems, RF/microwave design, and applied electromagnetics.



## ðŸ“¡ RF & Analog Projects

### ðŸ”¹ [Microstrip RF Interconnect Simulation](https://github.com/nicolasramosee/microstrip-rf-simulation)
Simulates a 3-port microstrip structure with an open-circuited stub using the `scikit-rf` library. Analyzes S-parameters across a 1â€“10â€¯GHz sweep to identify optimal impedance matching conditions and stub tuning effects.

### ðŸ”¹ [Wideband Analog PLL Signal Generator](https://github.com/yourusername/wideband-analog-pll)
Designed and simulated a VCO-based PLL signal generator for analog RF testing, roughly from kHz to 100 MHz. Includes loop filter tuning, phase noise analysis, and schematic documentation.



## ðŸ’»  Embedded Systems Projects

### ðŸ”¹ [Study Space Occupancy System (IoT)](https://github.com/nicolasramosee/Study-Space-Availability-System)
An ESP32-based occupancy monitoring system deployed within the University of Miamiâ€™s Richter Library. The system integrates VL53L5CX and VL53L1X LiDAR sensors, MEMS omnidirectional microphone-based audio analysis, and Wi-Fi sniffing to detect and estimate study area occupancy. A Firebase backend was used to enable real-time data updates and remote access to occupancy insights.
